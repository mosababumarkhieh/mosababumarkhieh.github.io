    <h1>My Interests</h1>

    <p>
      I am especially interested in <strong>technology</strong>,
      <strong>reading</strong>, and <strong>religious studies</strong>. I enjoy
      reading both fiction and non-fiction, particularly books that explore
      philosophy, history, and belief systems. I also like learning about how
      technology shapes society and the way we access knowledge. One website that
      I would probably visit is 
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN Web Docs</a>.
      I am currently reading a fictional series called 
      <a href="https://www.webnovel.com/book/lord-of-mysteries_11022733006234505/crimson_31208015751346911">
        <i>Lord Of Mysteries</i>
      </a>.
